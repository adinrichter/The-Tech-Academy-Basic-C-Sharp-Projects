# C# Projects
These are my school C# projects along with some that I've done myself

## Projects:
* [Car Insurance Calculator](https://github.com/adinrichter/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Web%20Application/Car%20Insurance)
* [Daily Report](https://github.com/adinrichter/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/Daily%20Report)

### Car insurance
This is an MVC Web application that generates an insurance quote based on business logic.
It also has an admin panel with administrative properties.

### Daily Report
This is a console app that takes user input for a day at school and saves it to a text file.
